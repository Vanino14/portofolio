				Nice to meet you! My name is Marco Gunawan, and I come from a background in technology information. Over the past five years, I have gained valuable work experience in both accounting and Production Planning and Inventory Control (PPIC). These roles have honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, as accuracy and precision are crucial in these domains.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, my true passion lies in programming. I have developed a strong affinity for coding and have familiarized myself with various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and C++. I find the process of writing code fascinating and enjoy the logical thinking required to solve complex problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				My desire to become a skilled programmer has been the driving force behind my recent studies. I have been dedicating a significant amount of time to learning and expanding my knowledge in programming concepts, best practices, and emerging technologies. I believe that continuous learning is essential in this rapidly evolving field, and I am committed to staying up to date with the latest advancements.
			</p>
			<p>
				Becoming a proficient programmer is not just a career goal for me; it is a personal aspiration. I thrive on challenges and find immense satisfaction in overcoming obstacles and creating elegant solutions to complex problems. The prospect of building innovative applications, websites, or software that can positively impact people's lives motivates me every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I may still have a lot to learn, I am determined and passionate about growing as a programmer. I embrace every opportunity to sharpen my skills, whether through personal projects, online courses, or collaborating with other like-minded individuals.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summary, my background in technology information, coupled with my experience in accounting and PPIC, has instilled in me a strong problem-solving ability and attention to detail. However, it is my passion for programming and my continuous efforts to improve that define my ambitions. I am excited about the prospect of pursuing my dream as a programmer and eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the ever-evolving world of technology.

				I am currently 22 years old, born in Bekasi on March 14, 2001.
